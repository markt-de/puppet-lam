## Overview

A puppet module to install and configure [LDAP Account Manager (LAM)](https://github.com/LDAPAccountManager/lam), a webfrontend for managing entries stored in an LDAP directory.

## Requirements

A working PHP installation as well as a properly configured webserver are required.

Both [puppet-php](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppet-php/) as well as [puppetlabs-apache](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-apache/) are highly recommended to setup a functional environment. This task is beyond the scope of this module.

## Usage

### Basic usage

The minimum configuration should at least specify the desired version:

```puppet
class { 'lam':
  version => '7.3',
}
```

This will install and configure LAM. You should use the symlink target (which defaults to `/opt/lam`) as the document root when setting up the webserver.

LAM needs write access to several directories, so if your webserver runs with a different user account, you should specify the following additional parameters:

```puppet
class { 'lam':
  group   => 'wwwgroup',
  user    => 'wwwuser',
  version => '7.3',
}
```

The module maintains a dedicated data directory for LAM, so configuration and runtime data is not lost when upgrading. The location of this directory can be customized:

```puppet
class { 'lam':
  datadir => '/path/to/lam-data',
  version => '7.3',
}
```

### Pro edition

In theory the Pro edition of LAM is supported by the `$edition` parameter. You need to download it from the customer portal and place the archive on a local mirror, which should later be specified by using the `$mirror` parameter.

However, due to the lack of a test license this feature is untested.

```puppet
class { 'lam':
  edition => 'pro',
  mirror  => 'http://company.example.com/path/to/archive/%s',
  version => '7.3',
}
```

Classes and parameters are documented in [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md).
